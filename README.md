# Exploring neural networks

This project aims to use neural networks for diverse machine learning tasks. This is done using keras/tensorflow for Python. The three tasks are: 

- Classification with the iris dataset using a simple multilayer perceptron
- Classification with the Fashion MNIST dadaset usig a simple multilayer perception, with dropout, batch-normalization and residual connections
- Classification with the Breast Histopathology dataset using CNNs
